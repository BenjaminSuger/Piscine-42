# Piscine-42

## What is the 'piscine' ? 

The Piscine is the final step in the process to be accepted as a student at 42 schools. It consists of a month of intensive coding exercises, group projects, and exams in C programming. After this month of challenges and learning, you may (or may not) be accepted into 42 schools.

## My piscine

Period; January-February 2025

After a month of hard work, I successfully passed the Piscine and became a 42 student in Paris.   
I made a series of videos in French about my experience. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGxEeC4WP3w&list=PLAk-vDFK4Fwa69WTV76AOeqHwzHKVghwQ
